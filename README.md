This is a Next.js app that will display weather conditions tailored to astrophotography purposes, reading data from a custom backend. The goal is to be able to plan photograpy sessions over a set of personally-selected locations quickly. I wanted to keep the frontend of this app open, but for privacy purposes the backend will be kept private.

## Getting Started

First, install the necessary packages:

```bash
pnpm i
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Note that you will need to set up a `.env.local` file with the appropriate environment variables for the backend API.
